Demo for 04/03/2025


we'll prepare a semi working demo.


User will give input prompt by voice or text.
The llm will take a input image of the screenshot and decide what should be next course of action.
The llm will return a list of steps that needs to be completed to get the task done.
After each step the system will give the screenshot and the vison llm will verify if the task is successfully executed.
It will mark it done and start to proceed next task at hand. 
We'll add a shortcut key as to give screenshot to the llm.
