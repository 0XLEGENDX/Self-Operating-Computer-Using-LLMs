1) Input will be given through voice activation and query will be listened 

This script uses the vosk library for speech recognition to listen for a wake word ("hello") and execute a command when detected. It sets up a callback function using sounddevice to capture audio data in real-time. The KaldiRecognizer processes the audio and matches speech to the predefined wake word. Once the word is recognized, it triggers the run_script() function to execute a Python script (your_script.py). The script runs continuously, listening for the wake word until it is detected.


2) After the query the LLM will be prompted to do tasks.

To have complete control over GUI the llm needs to have access to all the gui elements and available windows. - completed
The LLM should also remember past actions and data to make sure it should not be stuck in the future tasks that need past data.


To get control over the GUI applications we've got control of all active windows and traversed through all available interactive elements
in the current active window that we need right now to perform current action.

We'll use memory to remeber past actions and responses to make sure we don't stuck in the future due to past data or not repeat past mistakes.


3) Agent components


1) LLM Agent + Vision + memory

The LLM Agent will get a prompt which will include a starting point.
The prompt will contain which window is currently active, background active windows and all the interactive elements in the current window.
The LLM will return response for the first step to do to execute the task



__ actions that can be performed are

A) open_active_window(window_name)
B) keyboard_keys_click([Key,Key])
C) click_element(element_name)
D) input_text(element_name , text)


The response will be in this json schema

    {"Reason" : "Brief reason why we're performing this action.",
     "action" : "click_element(element_name)",
     "memory" : "Explain the whole status in brief, list down all the important things that needs to be knows for possible future use."}


Actions will be performed by the controlled by gui_controller module which has functions to get access to all windows and it's elements.
